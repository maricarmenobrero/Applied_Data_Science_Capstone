# Data 

This folder hosts datasets used in the Applied Data Science Capstone.  

Large or sensitive files are **not** tracked in Git. Use links or local paths instead:

- SpaceX API: https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/...
- Wikipedia tables (web scraping): <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches>

Place files under `data/raw/`. Do not commit sensitive or large files.

## Folder structure

- `raw/` — Original, unmodified data (downloaded from external sources). *Not tracked.*
- `processed/` — Cleaned/curated datasets ready for analysis and modeling.
