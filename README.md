# Applied_Data_Science_Capstone

## Description

Applied Data Science Capstone - Course Repository

This repository contains my **coursework for the Applied Data Science Capstone**. It aggregates every lab and deliverable—data wrangling with APIs and web scraping, EDA/SQL, interactive visual analytics with Folium and Plotly Dash, and predictive modeling—so peers can review, reproduce, and reuse the work.

## Structure:

- `labs/` – Jupyter notebooks for each module

- `dashboards/` – Plotly Dash apps and assets

- `data/` – sample files or links to external sources

- `reports/` – slides, summaries, and the final presentation

- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies
